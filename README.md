JMaNGOS is an educational project.

This means, our primary interest is to learn and teach us and our users more about Java project development in a large scale. Our software is not intended for running public servers, and we do not support that.

Acknowledgement: Java, Eclipse, Maven, Nexus, Jenkins and Git.

Supported platforms (JVMs): Sun, Oracle, OpenJDK.
